# Aalto AI Geeks Space analytics tool

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing various open spaces using camera technology. By leveraging cameras, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and utilization of open areas. The optimization process involves two pipelines: real-time processing with lightweight distill models and post-processing analysis, including the examination of heat maps.

## Features
- Real-time processing utilizing lightweight distill models for immediate optimization insights
- Post-processing analysis to further analyze and optimize open spaces through heat map evaluations
